# Remote Sensing Lectures Notes

This repository contains my MATLAB live lecture notes in HTML format. Numerous references are used to produce these lecture notes. The MATLAB live files will be added soon.

Note: These lecture notes are a summary of several materials and many of the images are obtained from the web. The main text is obtained from the following references:

1. Microwave Radar and Radiometric Remote Sensing (2014), Fawwaz T. Ulaby, David G. Long, William Blackwell, Kamal Sarabandi, Charles Elachi.
2. Physical Principles of Remote Sensing (2001) 2nd Edition by W. G. Rees.
